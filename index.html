<h2>Pick Orange Over Other Fruits</h2>
	<p>
		As you stroll around the stalls of the fruit market, a store vendor at your
		nearest vinicity beckons you to take a look at his produce. After taking a quick
		glance about, you notice the various delicious and equally enticing pieces 
		of fruits. The deep flush of tiny red strawberries tinted with specks of white 
		seed is strangely placed next to a gaint round watermelon with beautifully 
		carved strips of green and black. Grapes of different colors glitter from the
		light of the sun and catches your eyes. But do not let these inferior fruits
		beguile you with their mere appearance and spoil you from the taste of true 
		deliciousness. Lying humbly at the rear of the stall is the oranges and they 
		are the master of all fruits.
