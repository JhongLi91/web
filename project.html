<h1>Intro to Elmsley's Problem</h1> 
	<p>
    The purpose of Elmsley's problem is to find the shortest series of shuffles
    that would make any card in a standard 52 deck from position p to the top. 
    The shuffle here refers to a form of perfect shuffle where you break a deck 
    of cards into two equal halves and put them in alternating orders. There are 2 forms of perfect 
    shuffle that the solution would be using, the out shuffle and the in shuffle. 
    The only difference between the out shuffle and the in shuffle is the position 
    of the top card. If the top card remains at the top after the shuffle, it is the 
    out shuffle and if the top ends up as the second position, it is the in shuffle. 
    With a combination of such shuffles, you can bring any card to the top.
