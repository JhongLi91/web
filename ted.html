    The way our brain learn is through experiencing many different possiblities.
    After experiencing an event, our brain will deem it either a failure that should
    discarded or a success that should be kept. These networks represent all the possibility that could occur.
    In machine learning, these networks are simply mathematical operations. An given input of
    data will run through many, many different networks of training, creating a bunch of possibility. <thead>
    job of the of AI is to decide which one of these new datas are worth keeping.

    Gradient

  <p>
    Gradient is the cornerstone to any machine learning system. If you have taken multivariable calculus or linear algebra you will probably be familiar with this term.
    But for those that dont, gradient is like a function that takes in an input and returns a vector that points at the largest ascent.
    In this 3D graph, imagine the curve being our data plotted. We can take the gradient and find the largest ascend as shown by the arrows. Machine learning uses gradient descent which is basically this arrow but pointing at the opposite direction
    Why are gradients important for machine learning you may ask. Gradient points toward the highest increase given a function or data, and what machine learning wants is to find a way to optimize these data points. By know where the largest increase, or in our case the largest decrease is at, we could find out how to optimize our data the best.
    Tensorflow provides methods that do the gradient calculation for you.

  <h1>
    Models
  </h1>
  <p>
    A model is abstractly:
  </p>
    <li>
        A function that computes something on tensors (a forward pass)
    </li>

    <li>
        Some variables that can be updated in response to trainings
    </li>

  <p>
    For easier understanding, models are just some kind of function that serves as a checkpoint for trainings.
  </p>

  <h1>
    Training
  </h1>

  <p>
    Many machine learning systems have a way to train its models that's how it gets smarter and its purpose is to simply make better models each time it is trained.
    Solving machine learning problems usually follow these steps:

    There are other kinds of loss functions like Mean Absolute Error loss, square or quadratic loss functions. Machine learning use loss functions to determine whether or not the new model is better than the previous one. The goal is to minimize the loss.

    On this graph, we can see the blue dots as our trainable datas and the orange curve which is our ground truth
    The green line is our first model, this is usually randomized because in real life applications we do not know what the ground truth is. But here we know it's linear for the sake of simplicity. You can see here it says  â€œin practice these should be randomly initialized.
