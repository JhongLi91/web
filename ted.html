  <p>
    The way our brain learn is through experiencing many different possiblities.
    After experiencing an event, our brain will deem it either a failure that should
    discarded or a success that should be kept. These networks represent all the possibility that could occur.
    In machine learning, these networks are simply mathematical operations. An given input of
    data will run through many, many different networks of training, creating a bunch of possibility. <thead>
    job of the of AI is to decide which one of these new datas are worth keeping.
