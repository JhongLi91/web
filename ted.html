  <h1>
    History of Tensorflow
  </h1>

  <p>
    Tensorflow is an open-sourced library created by Google researchers,
    on November 9, 2015, with the goal of exploring machine learning. It
    is a second-generation machine learning system and the first one is
    Distbelief, which was released in 2011. The advantage of using
    Tensorflow is that it supports both CPUs and GPUs. It also compiles
    faster than other deep learning competitors like Torch and Kera.

  <p>
    Tensorflow uses neural networks, which is a technique used by computers to process data.
    A fun fact about neural networks is that it was actually inspired by the human brain.
    When given a problem, your brain creates connections and learns to associate which action
    will result in a failure and which one will result in a success. A collection of software
    will continuously create connections and attempt to solve a given problem. Connections that
    lead to failure will be terminated while the ones that lead to success will be kept, which
    ultimately makes the capability of the computer stronger at solving that problem. Ultimately, the way our
    brain learn is through experiencing many different possiblities.
    After experiencing an event, our brain will deem it either a failure that should
    discarded or a success that should be kept. These networks represent all the possibility that could occur.
    In machine learning, these networks are simply mathematical operations. An given input of
    data will run through many, many different networks of training, creating a bunch of possibility. <thead>
    job of the of AI is to decide which one of these new datas are worth keeping.

  <h1>
    Application of Tensorflow
  </h1>

  <p>
      Some real life applications of Tensorflow are: Image Recognition, Voice Recognition, Video Detection, and Text-based Applications.
  </p>

  <h1>
    Tensors
  </h1>

  <p>
    Tensorflow runs on multi-dimensional arrays, otherwise known as tensors. A tensor’s shape tells you the size of the tensor along each of its axes. A tensor’s dtype tells you the type of all the elements in the tensor.

  <h1>
    Gradient
  </h1>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Gradient_vectors_on_cos%28x%29%2Acos%28y%29.png" alt=" 3D graph with gradient vectors">
  <p>
    Gradient is the cornerstone to any machine learning system. If you have taken multivariable calculus or linear algebra you will probably be familiar with this term.
    But for those that dont, gradient is like a function that takes in an input and returns a vector that points at the largest ascent.
    In this 3D graph, imagine the curve being our data plotted. We can take the gradient and find the largest ascend as shown by the arrows. Machine learning uses gradient descent which is basically this arrow but pointing at the opposite direction
    Why are gradients important for machine learning you may ask. Gradient points toward the highest increase given a function or data, and what machine learning wants is to find a way to optimize these data points. By know where the largest increase, or in our case the largest decrease is at, we could find out how to optimize our data the best.
    Tensorflow provides methods that do the gradient calculation for you.

  <h1>
    Models
  </h1>
  <p>
    A model is abstractly:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A function that computes something on tensors (a forward pass)
      </li>
      <li>
        Some variables that can be updated in response to trainings
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    For easier understanding, models are just some kind of function that serves as a checkpoint for trainings.
  </p>

  <h1>
    Training
  </h1>

  <p>
    Many machine learning systems have a way to train its models that's how it gets smarter and its purpose is to simply make better models each time it is trained.
    Solving machine learning problems usually follow these steps:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
        Obtain trainable data
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the model
    </li>
    <li>
        Define a loss function
    </li>
    <li>
        Run through the training data, calculating loss from the ideal value
    </li>
    <li>
        Calculate gradients for that loss and use an optimizer to adjust the variables to fit the data
    </li>
    <li>
        Evalute your results
    </li>
  </ul>
