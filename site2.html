<h1>Benefits of Oranges</h1>
	<p>
		It is not a voice of an opinion but through utterly true facts that orange is 
		the tastiest among all other fruits, just like how it should not be disputed that cats are better than dogs. However, even as asserted thus, people may find themselves the counterargument
		of discussing the health benefits that other fruits have. It should be laiden out that orange also has several nutritious benefits
		too. Just like how the wise old nursey song goes: a orange a day keeps the doctor away.

		<ul>
			<li>It boost immune system</li>
			<li>Has anti-inflammatory</li>
			<li>Improve oral health</li>
			<li>Prevent cancer to a certain extend</li>
			<li>Great source of vitamins</li>
		</ul>
