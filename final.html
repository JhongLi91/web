<h1>Elmsley's Problem</h1> 
	<p>
    The purpose of Elmsley's problem is to find the shortest series of shuffles
    that would make any card in a standard 52 deck from position p to the top. 
    The shuffle here refers to a form of perfect shuffle where you break a deck 
    of cards into two equal halves and put them in alternating orders. There are 2 forms of perfect 
    shuffle that the solution would be using, the out shuffle and the in shuffle. 
    The only difference between the out shuffle and the in shuffle is the position 
    of the top card. If the top card remains at the top after the shuffle, it is the 
    out shuffle and if the top ends up as the second position, it is the in shuffle. 
    With a combination of such shuffles, you can bring any card to the top.

	The algorithm used to bring a card at position p to the top is taken from this paper:

		How to use the program
	</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		First and foremost, you must run the program and then read the provided notes. 
	</li>	
	<li>
		The program will ask you whether or not you want a randomly generated deck of 
	    	cards. 
		<li type="circle">
			If you selected "no" the program will provide you with a ordered deck
			starting from Ace, 2, 3, ..., J, Q, K.
		</li>
	</li>
	<li>
		After you have received your deck of cards, you can choose any card you wish to bring
		to the top. DON'T add '' to your selected card. 
	</li>
	<li>    
	    	The program will calculate the sequence of in and out shuffles for which will bring your
		selected card to the top. It also provides the deck of cards after shuffling in such a
		sequence.
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally, the program will ask you whether or not you want to see each individual shuffles.
		I recommend that you do as it is very helpful in understanding the Elmsley's Problem.

		The 0th shuffle is the orginial deck.
